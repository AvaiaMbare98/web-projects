A quick project I made during my roadmap.sh journey (https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv). 
Working with this simple CV, I learned how to use semantic HTML to give meaning to the sections of my website, while improving my HTML basic skills
about the fundamental tags. 
I used for the first time SEO meta tags and OG tags also, which I didn't know how to use. 

It was a fun project, and I built my first CV using my freshly learned web develoing skills!
